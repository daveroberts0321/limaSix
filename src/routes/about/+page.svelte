	<p>
		Founded in 1992 by Harvey A Shuhart, Jr., Control Dynamics Corporation has been committed to providing products and services with a satisfaction level unobtainable elsewhere on earth.

Harvey A Shuhart Jr. was a talented electrical engineer and inventor. One of his most successful inventions was the helmet radio, which was used by the National Football League for coach-to-player communications for two decades. Harvey also provided mission-critical communications systems for police, fire and EMS services.

Harvey A Shuhart Jr. sadly passed away in 2023, upon which his son Harvey A Shuhart III became the new president of Control Dynamics Corporation. With 19 years of experience as a product designer and manufacturing engineer, Harvey A Shuhart III aims to bring a whole new line of products to CDC.

Among those new products is the LIMA SIX: A belt fed upper receiver for AR15â€™s which is affordable and has features never before available on other firearm platforms.
